# python-bootcamp
(Hopefully) building Python skills and techniques for typical physics tasks.

If you have a computer and want to follow along, download bootcamp.ipynb and open in Jupyter. If you're not a git user, then:
1. Click the filename above, which will take you to a preview of the file on GitHub.
2. Click the "Download raw file" button (download arrow icon) near the top left of the page.


Along the way you will also need my_pkge.py in the same folder on your computer, which you can get the same way.
